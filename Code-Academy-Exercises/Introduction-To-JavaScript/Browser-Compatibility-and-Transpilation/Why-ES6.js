var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = "You can make carbonara with " + pasta + ", " + meat + ", " + " and a sauce made with " + sauce + ".";

//ES6 is syntactically more similar to other OOP languages, which is better for OOP devs that dont know JS
//The code is more legible.
//Squashes those pesky ES5 BUGS.


//manually changed the code in this assignment to ES5 syntax.
