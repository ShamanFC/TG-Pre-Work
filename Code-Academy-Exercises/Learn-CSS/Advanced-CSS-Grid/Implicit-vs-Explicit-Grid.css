/*
an explicit grid is a grid created with all of the information that will be displayed known, and styled accordingly

an implicit grid is made when the the amount of items in a grid is greater than specified. CSS takes over with an algorithm;

items take up rows, adding more if nessicary - new rows will only be tall enough to contain the content
